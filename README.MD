# Repository for Hosting Portfolio Comments

This repository is used to host all [my portfolio](https://blog.terminels.com) reviews. It is implemented based on the open source [project Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus).

The basic implementation principle is to use the Github API to bind all comments to the discussion topic posts in this repository.

If you want to know how to use Giscus, you can refer to [its website](https://giscus.app/)

This comment hosting platform is constantly reviewing to remove potentially harmful comments. 



In order to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding, if you want to comment on the content in my Portfolio, please do not comment directly in the Discussion in the repository, but directly comment under the specific post in my Portfolio.
